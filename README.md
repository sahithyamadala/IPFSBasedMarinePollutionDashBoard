#IPFS Pollution Monitoring
This project is a decentralized pollution monitoring system that uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to securely store and share pollution reports uploaded by users.

#Overview
User-Uploaded Reports: Users can upload pollution reports which are stored on the IPFS network.

Authority Access via IPFS Hash: Authorities can access and verify pollution reports using the unique IPFS content hash (CID) provided by users.

Decentralized & Tamper-Proof: Data stored on IPFS is immutable and distributed, preventing tampering or loss.

Transparency & Accountability: The system promotes transparent sharing of pollution data between users and authorities.

How It Works
Users create and upload pollution reports to the IPFS network.

IPFS generates a unique content hash (CID) for each uploaded report.

Users share the CID with the relevant authorities.

Authorities retrieve the report from IPFS using the CID to review and verify the data.
